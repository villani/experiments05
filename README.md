experiments05
=============

Sub-bases were constructed from the bases created in Experiments04. For each ARFF base from Experiments04, more four sub-bases were created, one for each axe of the IRMA code. An evaluating is performed about what extracting features techniques provides features more relevant and for what axis. The performance from the multi-label classification was evaluated too through from problem transform and algorithm adapting approach.
